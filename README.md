## The Repository

Cosmic design is a concrete practice of [D2R](https://design-to-release.github.io/docs).
This repository is where we develop it together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap , development guide. This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

## How it works

The template required a minimum [dependencies](package.json). Only **Vite** is used for building, nothing more.

### Project Structure

The structure of this template is very similar to the structure of a monorepo.

The entire source code of the program is divided into three modules (packages) that are bundled each independently:

- [`src/core`](src/core)
  Include common dependencies, such as components, utils, ipc.
- [`src/app`](src/app)
  Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
- [`src/workbench`](src/workbench)
  Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page).

### Cosmic Components

- [Components StoryBook](https://design-to-release.github.io/cosmic/components)
- [`src/core/components`](src/core/components)

### Compile App

Next step is run packaging and compilation a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux with "auto update" support out of the box.

To do this, using the [electron-builder]:

- In npm script `compile`: This script is configured to compile the application as quickly as possible. It is not ready for distribution, is compiled only for the current platform and is used for debugging.
- In GitHub Action: The application is compiled for any platform and ready-to-distribute files are automatically added to the draft GitHub release.
